# Karatsuba algorithm visualization for Svelte

## Styling

To make the line numbers work properly you might need to wrap the component in
an element with a `counter-reset: karatsuba-line` CSS rule.

You may style the display by targeting the following selectors:

- `pre` for the whole display
- `.comment` for calculation explanations on each row
- `.counter::before` for row numbers
